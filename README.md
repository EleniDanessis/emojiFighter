# Emoji Fighter

This project was made for educational purposes but could be applied as a simple component of a game - choose your character, for example. 

When I was teaching, I remember using 'this or that' pictures as good icebreakers and/or conversation starters. They can also be used for workouts (e.g. either do sit ups or push ups). As you can see, there are lots of applications. 

It's totally a throwback to the 90s, I know!

You can click on the 'Pick Fighters!' as many times as you'd like to switch characters. To return to the landing page, simply refresh the browser!
